Problem Statement
The fast-changing job market often makes it difficult
for students to identify career paths matching their
skills, interests, and future opportunities. Traditional
career counseling is time-consuming and
unpersonalized, with failure to update on the latest
industry trends. Students make uninformed choices
that may result in career misfits and underutilization
of potential.
